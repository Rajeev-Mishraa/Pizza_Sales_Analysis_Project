## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing pizza sales data using SQL queries. The dataset includes information about pizza orders, including order quantities, prices, sizes, types, and timestamps. 

### Here are the 13 problem statements that were solved using SQL techniques:
1. Total Orders: Retrieve the total number of orders placed.

2. Total Revenue: Calculate the total revenue generated from pizza sales.

3. Highest-Priced Pizza: Identify the highest-priced pizza.

4. Common Pizza Size: Identify the most common pizza size ordered.

5. Top Pizza Types: List the top 5 most ordered pizza types along with their quantities.

6. Pizza Category Quantity: Join tables to find the total quantity of each pizza category ordered.

7. Order Distribution: Determine the distribution of orders by hour of the day.

8. Category-Wise Pizza Distribution: Join tables to find the category-wise distribution of pizzas.

9. Average Daily Orders: Group orders by date and calculate the average number of pizzas ordered per day.

10. Top Revenue Pizza Types: Determine the top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue.

11. Revenue Contribution: Calculate the percentage contribution of each pizza type to total revenue.

12. Cumulative Revenue: Analyze the cumulative revenue generated over time.

13. Top Revenue Pizza Types per Category: Determine the top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue for each pizza category.

### SQL Functions: 
To efficiently answer these queries, we solved them using a combination of SQL techniques such as JOIN, Subquery, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, and TOP etc. The queries provide valuable insights into pizza sales trends, popular items, revenue contributions, and overall performance over time.
